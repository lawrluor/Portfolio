      "text": "Hello all, welcome to my travel blog where I capture my experiences and thoughts over a month-long trip through Taiwan and China. In this first post, I lay out some guidelines and goals to keep myself motivated and focus the scope of my blog. Be as honest and authentic as possible. If this blog were my instagram, this would be the writing equivalent of #nofilter. This means I will try to avoid excessive editing and over-processing in my posts, instead revising primarily for clarity. Include a variety of subjects. There’ll be a lot of downtime, so I’ll sneak in some other thoughts and keep it spicy. Focus on just a few encounters/destinations per post, to dig deeper and avoid a “grocery-list” style blog. Update every other day or so, to keep me motivated to write. Thanks for your interest! There’ll be more to come soon :)"
