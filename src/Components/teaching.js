/*
Greetings! I'm Lawrence, a graduate from Boston University with a degree in Psychology & Computer Science. I have 7+ years of tutoring experience spread across Computer Science & Coding subjects for students of all levels.

My experience with software topics includes web & mobile app development with Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and React-Native. If you are interested in any of the subjects I tutor in, or are wondering if I can tutor in a specific subject not listed here, please don't hesitate to reach out and ask!

All my life, I have known the immense value of teaching. I have experience at all levels: as a volunteer for elementary school students, a private tutor for middle and high school students, a teaching assistant for college students, and a Wyzant tutor for adult learners. These experiences have shaped my passion for educating others and have helped me understand a wide variety of student learning styles.

My tutoring style is based around understanding the student's specific needs and providing a personalized, holistic, and enjoyable learning experience. I determine the student's reasons for learning the subject, the specific parts of the subject that interest them, and their learning style. As a cross-sectional person with interests in technology, psychology, and music, I also make sure that the concepts I teach come with the context of their real-world applications. Finally, I invest myself in my students and I expect them to take similar responsibility for their own progress.
